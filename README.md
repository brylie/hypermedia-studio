hypermedia-studio
=================

A drag-and-drop creativity studio for publishing rich hypermedia experiences.


Principles
==========
Human-centric design
--------------------
Design the system from the user perspective.

Show, don't tell
----------------
Show immediate responsiveness to interaction. Don't require the user to think like a computer, show the actual output.

Direct manipulation
-------------------
Make it easy to work directly with the medium. Don't force the user through layers of complexity and disconnected interfaces.

Don't Repeat Yourself / Proudly Not Invented Here
----------
Build on existing components. Reuse components, content, etc. Encourage nesting, inclusion, etc.

Keep it Open
-----------
Protect the sourcecode, perserve access for all. Develop and document in the open.
